# W100 | Inefficient Asset Creation
Siv3D's W100 warning arises when assets are repeatedly created and discarded across sequential frames. Continually creating and disposing of high-cost assets, like `Texture`, `Audio`, `Font`, can severely impact performance.

## Code Example That Trigger W100 Warning
```cpp
# include <Siv3D.hpp>

void Main()
{
	while (System::Update())
	{
		// Every frame this reads from the image file and creates a new texture. This is not efficient.
		const Texture texture(U"example/windmill.png");
		
		// The texture gets rendered.
		texture.draw();
		
		// The frame concludes, and the texture is disposed of.
	}
}
```


## Why the Warning is Issued
Asset classes (`Texture`, `Audio`, `Font`, etc.) involve operations that are resource-intensive, such as reading files and allocating memory. If created continuously in a loop for each frame, performance can be notably hampered. This warning activates when the following asset classes are detected as being continuously created and discarded across 30 consecutive frames:

- `Texture`
- `Audio`
- `Font`
- `DynamicTexture`
- `RenderTexture`
- `MSRenderTexture`
- `Mesh`
- `Model`
- `Effect`
- `Script`
- `VertexShader`
- `PixelShader`


## Ways to Address the Warning

### Method 1: Pre-loop Asset Initialization
Below, the texture is instantiated prior to the loop's onset. This texture is then reused, preventing performance deterioration from repeated asset creation and disposal:

```cpp
# include <Siv3D.hpp>

void Main()
{
	const Texture texture{ U"example/windmill.png" };

	while (System::Update())
	{
		texture.draw();
	}
}
```

This approach is straightforward, but all assets need upfront loading, potentially extending initial loading times. For deferred loading, see Methods 2 or 3.


### Method 2: Adopt Asset Management Functions
In this method, asset management functions oversee the texture. Assets are only created the first time they are accessed:

```cpp
# include <Siv3D.hpp>

void Main()
{
	TextureAsset::Register(U"Windmill", U"example/windmill.png");

	while (System::Update())
	{
		TextureAsset(U"Windmill").draw();
	}
}
```


### Method 3: Curb Redundant Asset Creation
Here, the texture is created within the main loop. However, redundant creation is mitigated by managing variable states:

```cpp
# include <Siv3D.hpp>

void Main()
{
	Texture texture;

	// Flag for whether the texture load failed
	bool failed = false;

	while (System::Update())
	{
		// If the texture is not created and has not failed to load
		if ((not texture) && (not failed))
		{
			if (SimpleGUI::Button(U"Load", Vec2{ 40, 40 }))
			{
				texture = Texture{ U"example/windmill.png" };

				// If the texture load failed
				if (not texture)
				{
					failed = true;
				}
			}
		}

		// If the texture is created, draw it
		if (texture)
		{
			texture.draw();
		}
	}
}
```


## Warning Suppression
In specific scenarios, you might prefer to disable this warningâ€”for performance assessment, debugging, or when willing to accept the associated performance risks. To do so, utilize `Profiler::EnableAssetCreationWarning(false)`.
